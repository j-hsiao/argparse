want:
	(auto?) thing = parser.add<type, num>(name, help, );

	thing should be useable as corresponding type.
	thing should be registered into parser
	(must have constructor, or return a reference)
	or must add with a macro (declare var and then register its addr)
	if constructor:
		parser is not copyable (args not unique...)
		constructor must be passed parser address to register itself
		cannot be aggregate because need constructor
		must contain pointer to parser
		(returned thing->move constructor, but must modify parser to point to new result)



	though reference means object would be copyable

	maybe add support for merged flags?
	like tar -xvf file
	in this case, - vs -- is significant
	must be boolean flag to merge

	parser must do the traversal of args since same commandline arg could
	represent multiple flags.
